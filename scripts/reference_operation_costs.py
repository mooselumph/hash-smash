"""Count data-path operations in trusted reference cores; never run candidates.

These are portable normalization estimates, not cycle counts or attack bounds.
Public loop/index arithmetic, Python overhead, serialization and memory traffic
are excluded. Narrow rotations retain their explicit shifts, ORs and masks in
the 256-bit RAM model; no native 32/64-bit rotate is assumed.
